						Usually the address of the \hbox{\tt publisher} or other type
						of institution.
						For major publishing houses,
						van~Leunen recommends omitting the information entirely.
						For small publishers, on the other hand, you can help the
						reader by giving the complete address.
					-->

				<string>annote</string>
					<!--
						An annotation.
						It is not used by the standard bibliography styles,
						but may be used by others that produce an annotated bibliography.

						in the format described in the \LaTeX\ book.
					-->

				<string>booktitle</string>

						Title of a book, part of which is being cited.
						See the \LaTeX\ book for how to type titles.
						For book entries, use the \hbox{\tt title} field instead.

					<!--
						A chapter (or section or whatever) number.
					-->

				<string>crossref</string>
					<!--
						The database key of the entry being cross referenced.
					-->

				<string>edition</string>
					<!--
						The edition of a book - for example, ``Second''$\!$.
						This should be an ordinal, and
						should have the first letter capitalized, as shown here;
						the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary.
					-->

				<string>editor</string>
					<!--
						Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the \LaTeX\ book.
						If there is also an \hbox{\tt author} field, then
						the \hbox{\tt editor} field gives the editor of the book or collection

				<string>howpublished</string>
					<!--
						How something strange has been published.
						The first word should be capitalized.

						Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label when

						(described in Section~\ref{odds-and-ends}) is missing.

				<string>month</string>

						The first word should be capitalized.

				<string>number</string>
					<!--
						The number of a journal, magazine, technical report,
						or of a work in a series.
						An issue of a journal or magazine is usually
						identified by its volume and number;
						the organization that issues a
						technical report usually gives it a number;
						and sometimes books are given numbers in a named series.
					-->

				<string>organization</string>
					<!--
						The organization that sponsors a conference or that publishes a \hbox{manual}.

				<string>pages</string>
					<!--
						One or more page numbers or range of numbers,
						such as \hbox{\tt 42- -111} or \hbox{\tt 7,41,73- -97} or \hbox{\tt 43+}
						(the `{\tt +}' in this last example indicates pages following
						that don't form a simple range).
						To make it easier to maintain {\em Scribe\/}-compatible databases,
						the standard styles convert a single dash (as in \hbox{\tt 7-33})
						to the double dash used in \TeX\ to denote number ranges
						(as in \hbox{\tt 7- -33}).

					-->

				<string>school</string>

					-->

				<string>title</string>
					<!--
						The work's title, typed as explained in the \LaTeX\ book.

					<!--
						The year of publication or, for

						Generally it should consist of four numerals, such as {\tt 1984},
						although the standard styles can handle any {\tt year} whose
						last four nonpunctuation characters are numerals,
						such as `\hbox{(about 1984)}'$\!$.
