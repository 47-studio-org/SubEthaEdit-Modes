## Autocompletion Dictionaries: _AutocompleteAdditions.txt_

The file called `AutocompleteAdditions.txt` is located in the mode's `Resources` folder.  
It is the place for strings you want to show up in the autocompletion popup that are not keywords in the syntax definition.  
It contains one completion at a line.  

You get autocompletion suggestions by pressing `esc` while editing text.

If you don't want or need additional autocomplete strings: this file is optional and can be removed.
