## Autocompletion Dictionaries: _AutocompleteAdditions.txt_

The file called `AutocompleteAdditions.txt` is located in the modes Resources folder.  
It contains one completion at a line.  
Here is the place for strings you want to show up in the autocomplete function, that are not a keyword in the syntax definition. 
If you don't want or need additional autocomplete strings: this file is optional and can be removed.
